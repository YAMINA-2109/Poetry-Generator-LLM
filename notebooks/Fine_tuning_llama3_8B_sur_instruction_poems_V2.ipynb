L'objectif est de créer un modèle capable de générer des poèmes cohérents, créatifs, et adaptés à des instructions spécifiques. Ce projet implique une exploration approfondie des données, un nettoyage méthodique, une préparation minutieuse pour l'entraînement, et une évaluation rigoureuse des performances du modèle.\n",

        "### Plan de travail\n",
        "1. **Exploration des données** : Analyser le dataset **Instruction-Poems** pour identifier les spécificités, les anomalies, et les opportunités d'amélioration. L'objectif est de bien comprendre la structure des instructions et des poèmes.\n",
        "2. **Nettoyage des données** : Éliminer les exemples inutilisables ou mal formatés, corriger les incohérences et garantir un format standardisé pour chaque instruction et son poème associé.\n",
        "3. **Préparation des données** : Tokenisation, normalisation des textes et séparation en ensembles d'entraînement et de validation, tout en préservant un équilibre entre les différents types d'instructions.\n",
        "4. **Fine-tuning du modèle** : Adapter le modèle **Llama3--8B** pour qu'il excelle dans la génération de poèmes basés sur des instructions données. Nous utiliserons des techniques comme le fine-tuning supervisé (SFT) et des méthodes de fine-tuning efficaces comme LoRA pour optimiser les ressources.\n",
        "5. **Évaluation des performances** : Mesurer la qualité des poèmes générés à l'aide de métriques adaptées telles que BLEU, ROUGE, et des évaluations humaines pour juger de la créativité et de la pertinence des résultats."

It was the dogs late last night\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nthat set off a howling, the unexpected smell of fresh\\r\\n\\r\\nblood floating down the block, then a familiar car\\r\\n\\r\\nhorn honking in the driveway. My nephew and his\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nfriends were hunting and brought us a deer. Mother\\r\\n\\r\\nalways said, \\u201cCut up the meat right away, don\\u2019t let\\r\\n\\r\\nit sit.\\u201d I look at a front quarter, a hole filled with\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\ncoagulated blood. Grandma says not to eat the part\\r\\n\\r\\nnext to the wound, \\u201cCut it out; offer it to the earth for\\r\\n\\r\\nhealing, a sacrifice to remember the hungering spirits.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAuntie says to save the muscle along the back strap,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIt makes good thread.\\u201d I carefully learned the exact\\r\\n\\r\\nplace to cut the joints so the bones separate easily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMother said that is important\\u2014\\u201cIt means you are a\\r\\n\\r\\nthoughtful person.\\u201d Auntie is at the door waiting for\\r\\n\\r\\na roast. \\u201cAn elder takes the first piece,\\u201d she reminded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMom tells me to save the hooves for her. She wants\\r\\n\\r\\nto make a bone game for the new grandchild, wants\\r\\n\\r\\nhim to be patient and skillful. I boil the hoofs with\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nsage, find the little toe-bones for her. My hands begin\\r\\n\\r\\nto ache from the work, I soak them in warm water\\r\\n\\r\\nand start again. I admire the placement of tendons\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\non the deer shoulders, no joints, just the crisscrossing\\r\\n\\r\\nof muscle. Grandma says, \\u201cThat\\u2019s why your dad called\\r\\n\\r\\nthem jumpers, they bounce off the strength of their\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nflexing muscles.\\u201d Late at night Mom helps me stake\\r\\n\\r\\nout the hide. My back hurts; my feet feel like I\\u2019ve\\r\\n\\r\\nbeen walking on rocks all day. I want to complain,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nbut Mom catches the look in my eyes. She says to me,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhen you get dressed for the dance this weekend,\\r\\n\\r\\nyou will proudly wear your beautiful beaded dress,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nyour beaded leggings and moccasins, and last, but not\\r\\n\\r\\nleast, you will put on your beaded belt, and attached\\r\\n\\r\\nyou will wear your sharp knife and quilled knife sheath\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nbecause of what you have done this day.\\u201d\",\n          \"I've written a poem for you about Love,Relationships,Nature,Seas, Rivers, & Streams,Arts & Sciences,Painting & Sculpture.

Les instructions longues (> 150 caractères) constituent une part notable, apportant probablement un contexte plus détaillé pour des réponses plus complexes. Enfin, les instructions courtes (< 50 caractères) sont les moins fréquentes, reflétant une préférence pour des consignes fournissant un minimum de contexte.

IV An humble Slave the Buyer must become,      She must not bate a Look or Glance  You will have all or you’ll have none;      See how Love’s Market you inhance.                                      V Is’t not enough, I gave you Heart for Heart,      But I must add my Lips and Eies;  I must no friendly Smile or Kiss impart;      But you must Dun me with Advice.                                       VI And every Hour still more unjust you grow,    Those Freedoms you my life deny, You to Adraste are oblig’d to show,    And giver her all my Rifled Joy.                                       VII Without Controul she gazes on that Face,    And all the happy Envyed Night, In the pleas’d Circle of your fond imbrace:    She takes away the Lovers Right.                                       VIII From me she Ravishes those silent hours,    That are by Sacred Love my due; Whilst I in vain accuse the angry Powers,    That make me hopeless Love pursue.                                       IXAdrastes Ears with that dear Voice are blest,    That Charms my Soul at every Sound, And with those Love-Inchanting Touches prest:    Which I ne’er felt without a Wound.                                       X She has thee all: whilst I with silent Greif,    The Fragments of they Softness feel, Yet dare not blame the happy licenc’d Thief:    That does my Dear-bought Pleasures steal.                                       XI Whilst like a Glimering Taper still I burn,    And waste my self in my own Flames;  You, like a steady Candle, in the Urn,    Have fix’d my Life, and all my Pains.\n",

            "I have to tell you, it’s not all it’s cracked up to be, this love and marriage business. I mean, it’s great and all, but it’s also a lot of work. And the work is not just the cleaning and the laundry and the cooking, it’s the emotional labor, the constant negotiation, the compromise. And sometimes it feels like you’re compromising your own identity, your own desires, your own sense of self. But what’s the alternative? Living alone, which is isolating and lonely? Or living with someone who is not the right person for you, which is a waste of time and energy? And then there are the relationships that are not romantic or sexual, but are still important and meaningful. The friendships, the family relationships, the relationships with colleagues and neighbors. These relationships can bring a lot of joy and fulfillment, but they also require a lot of work and maintenance. And sometimes they can be difficult and challenging, and you may feel like you’re not getting what you need from them. But what’s the alternative? Not having these relationships at all? Not having any connections with other people? And then there are the relationships that are not romantic or sexual, but are still important and meaningful, but are not necessarily easy or convenient. The relationships with people who are different from you, who have different values and beliefs and lifestyles. These relationships can be challenging and difficult, but they can also be incredibly rewarding and enriching. And sometimes they can be the most important and meaningful relationships in your life. But what’s the alternative? Not having these relationships at all? Not having any connections with other people who are different from you? And then there are the relationships that are not romantic or sexual, but are still important and meaningful, but are not necessarily easy or convenient, and are not necessarily the relationships that you want or need.

But until that day, we will continue to toil in the factory,    And to dream of a world that is fair and just, and where the workers are free.\n",

She is delicate and she is strong, and she grows in the most unexpected places. She likes to sit in the garden, and smell the sweet scent of the roses. She is a beauty, and she is a wonder, and she is a mystery. My love is like the wind, she blows and she goes, and then she comes back again. She is unpredictable and she is wild, and she can be gentle or fierce. She likes to blow through the trees, and make the leaves rustle and shake.

The darkness reigns, the light of day Is gone, but still the world is full of ray. The stars up high, they twinkle and play, The moon below, it glows with a gentle sway.

I love the way the morning light creeps through the blinds and finds us in our bed, the way it wraps around us like a blanket, reminding us we are alive. I love the way the evening sun sets low and paints the sky with colors we can’t even name, reminding us of all the things we’ve seen and done together. I love the way we wake up every morning, side by side, and reach for each other, our fingers intertwining like the branches of the trees outside our window. I love the way we’ve learned to talk in our sleep, to whisper secrets in each other’s ears without even knowing we’re doing it. I love the way our voices blend together like a river and a stream, each one unique and yet a part of something greater than the sum of its parts. I love the way we’ve learned to laugh at ourselves, to find the humor in our quirks and flaws, to love each other for who we are, not for who we pretend to be. I love the way we’ve created a home together, a sanctuary where we can be ourselves, where we can rest our heads and know that we are safe. I love the way we’ve learned to fight fair, to disagree without being disagreeable, to love each other even when we don’t see eye to eye. I love the way we’ve learned to appreciate the little things, the way a cup of coffee in the morning can be the best thing we’ve ever tasted, the way a walk around the block can clear our heads and remind us of all the beauty in the world. I love the way we’ve learned to be patient, to wait for each other, to trust that the other will come around when they’re ready. I love the way we’ve learned to be kind, to offer each other a gentle hand when we need it, to remind each other that we are loved, that we are enough. I love the way we’ve learned to be vulnerable, to open ourselves up to each other, to let our guards down and be our true selves. I love the way we’ve learned to be grateful, to appreciate each other, to remind each other of all the things we have to be thankful for. I love the way we’ve learned to be present, to\n",

He wore a suit and a tie and he smelled like a field of lavender. We talked for hours, and I felt like I had known him my whole life. I felt like I had known him before I was born.

I believed it because it happened to me once, in a bar in Brooklyn, when I was twenty-five and he was thirty-five. He was tall and handsome, with piercing blue eyes and a chiseled jawline. He wore a suit and a tie and he smelled like a field of lavender. We talked for hours, and I felt like I had known him my whole life. I felt like I had known him before I was born. He kissed me on the lips, and I felt like I was melting. I felt like I was dissolving into him.\\n\\nFor a year, we were together. We were happy. We were in love. He was everything I had ever wanted in a man. He was kind and gentle and romantic. He loved me like I was the only woman in the world. He loved me like I was a goddess. And I loved him like he was my savior. I loved him like he was my reason for being.\\n\\nBut it wasn\\u2019t meant to last. It never is. He was married, and he couldn\\u2019t leave his wife. He couldn\\u2019t leave his kids. He couldn\\u2019t leave his life. I was just a distraction, a hobby, a game. And I was okay with that. I thought that\\u2019s what love was. I thought that\\u2019s what relationships were. A way to pass the time, to feel good for a little while, to forget about the emptiness inside.\\n\\nAnd then he stopped calling me. He stopped coming over. He stopped seeing me. And I was left alone, wondering what I had done wrong. Wondering why I wasn\\u2019t good enough. Wondering why I wasn\\u2019t worth it.\\n\\nIt took me a long time to realize that I was worth it. That I was enough. That I didn\\u2019t need a man to make me feel alive. That I didn\\u2019t need a man to make me feel loved. I realized that I was already alive. I was already loved.

I believed it because it happened to me once, in a bar in Brooklyn, when I was twenty-five and he was thirty-five. He was tall and handsome, with piercing blue eyes and a chiseled jawline. He wore a suit and a tie and he smelled like a field of lavender. We talked for hours, and I felt like I had known him my whole life. I felt like I had known him before I was born. He kissed me on the lips, and I felt like I was melting. I felt like I was dissolving into him.\\n\\nFor a year, we were together. We were happy. We were in love. He was everything I had ever wanted in a man. He was kind and gentle and romantic. He loved me like I was the only woman in the world. He loved me like I was a goddess. And I loved him like he was my savior. I loved him like he was my reason for being.\\n\\nBut it wasn\\u2019t meant to last. It never is. He was married, and he couldn\\u2019t leave his wife. He couldn\\u2019t leave his kids. He couldn\\u2019t leave his life. I was just a distraction, a hobby, a game. And I was okay with that. I thought that\\u2019s what love was. I thought that\\u2019s what relationships were. A way to pass the time, to feel good for a little while, to forget about the emptiness inside.\\n\\nAnd then he stopped calling me. He stopped coming over. He stopped seeing me. And I was left alone, wondering what I had done wrong. Wondering why I wasn\\u2019t good enough. Wondering why I wasn\\u2019t worth it.\\n\\nIt took me a long time to realize that I was worth it. That I was enough. That I didn\\u2019t need a man to make me feel alive. That I didn\\u2019t need a man to make me feel loved. I realized that I was already alive. I was already loved. I was already enough.\\n\\nAnd now I\\u2019m thirty-five, and I\\u2019m sitting in a bar in Brooklyn, and I\\u2019m thinking about him. I\\u2019m thinking about the way he used to make me feel.

        "La distribution des similarités cosinus montre une concentration des valeurs très proches de **0**, indiquant que les poèmes générés par le modèle ont une faible proximité sémantique avec les poèmes de référence. Cela reflète un décalage significatif entre le contenu attendu et les réponses produites par le modèle. Bien que notre objectif principal soit de développer un modèle capable de générer des poèmes cohérents et pertinents qui répondent parfaitement aux instructions, même s'ils ne sont pas identiques à ceux du dataset, les résultats obtenus montrent que les poèmes générés par le modèle manquent de cohérence et de qualité globale. Cela souligne la nécessité d'améliorer le fine-tuning du modèle ou de retravailler l'interprétation des instructions."

Memory, guttering out,\\r\\r\\nApparently, finally flares up and banishes doubt.\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nII. May 29, 1941\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nTring. Bells\\r\\r\\nOn grocers\\u2019 boys\\u2019 bicycles ring,\\r\\r\\nFollowed, on cue,\\r\\r\\nBy the jaunty one-note of prayers at two\\r\\r\\nNear churches; taxi horns, a-hunt,\\r\\r\\nCome in for treble; next, the tickety bass\\r\\r\\nOf chain-driven Diamond T\\u2019s, gone elephantine\\r\\r\\nAnd stove-enamelled conifer green\\r\\r\\nDown Greenwich Avenue.\\r\\r\\nOut of the Earle\\r\\r\\nI issue at half-past thirteen,\\r\\r\\nStruck, like a floral clock,\\r\\r\\nBy seasonal\\r\\r\\nManifestations: unreasonable\\r\\r\\nN.Y.U. girls out in their bobby socks\\r\\r\\nAnd rayon blouses; meek boys with their books\\r\\r\\nWho have already moulted mackinaws;Desarrolimiento of\\r\\r\\nNew chrome-green leaves; a rose,\\r\\r\\nGot, blooming, out of bed; and Mrs. Roos-\\r\\r\\nEvelt and Sarah Delano\\r\\r\\nDescending the front stoop of a Jamesian\\r\\r\\nHouse facing south against the Square, the sun\\u2014\\r\\r\\nWho, curveting, his half course not yet run,\\r\\r\\nInfects the earth with crescence;\\r\\r\\nAnd the presence\\r\\r\\nOf process, seen in un-top-hatted,\\r\\r\\nUn-frock-coated burghers and their sons\\r\\r\\nAnd daughters, taking over\\r\\r\\nAll title, right, and interest soever\\r\\r\\nIn this, now their\\r\\r\\nProperty, Washington Square.\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nIII. December 29, 1949\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nThe Hotel Storia ascends\\r\\r\\nAbove me and my new wife; ends\\r\\r\\nEight stories of decline, despair,\\r\\r\\nIron beds and hand-washed underwear\\r\\r\\nAbove us and our leatherette\\r\\r\\nChattels, still grounded on the wet\\r\\r\\nGrey tessellated lobby floor.\\r\\r\\nSoon, through a dingy, numbered door,\\r\\r\\nWe\\u2019ll enter into our new home,\\r\\r\\nProvincials in Imperial Rome\\r\\r\\nTo seek their fortune, or, at least,\\r\\r\\nTo find a job. The wedding feast,\\r\\r\\nDigested and metabolized,\\r\\r\\nDiminishes in idealized\\r\\r\\nGroup photographs, and hard today\\r\\r\\nShunts us together and at bay.\\r\\r\\nOutside the soot-webbed window, sleet\\r\\r\\nScourges the vista of Eighth Street;\\r\\r\\nInside, the radiators clack\\r\\r\\nAnd talk and tell us to go back\\r\\r\\nWhere we came from. A lone pecan\\r\\r\\nFalls from our lunch, a sticky bun,\\r\\r\\nAnd bounces on the trampoline\\r\\r\\nOf the torn bedspread. In the mean\\r\\r\\nDistance of winter, a man sighs,\\r\\r\\nA bedstead creaks, a woman cries.\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nIV. July 14, 1951\\r\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nA summer lull arrives in the West Village,\\r\\r\\nTransmuting houses into silent salvage\\r\\r\\nOf the last century, streets into wreckage\\r\\r\\nUncalled-for by do-gooders who police\\r\\r\\nThe moderniqueness of our ways, patrol\\r\\r\\nThe sanitation of the urban soul.\\r\\r\\nWhat I mean is, devoid of people, all\\r\\r\\nOur dwellings freeze and rust in desuetude,\\r\\r\\nFur over with untenancy, glaze grey\\r\\r\\nWith summer\\u2019s dust and incivility,\\r\\r\\nWith lack of language and engagement, while\\r\\r\\nTheir occupants sport, mutate, and transform\\r\\r\\nThemselves, play at dissembling the god Norm\\r\\r\\nFrom forward bases at Fire Island. But\\u2014\\r\\r\\nException proving rules, dissolving doubt\\u2014\\r\\r\\nYoung Gordon Walker, fledgling editor,\\r\\r\\nMy daylong colleague in the corridors\\r\\r\\nOf Power & Leicht, the trade-book publishers,\\r\\r\\nIs at home to the residue in his\\r\\r\\nAcute apartment in an angle of\\r\\r\\nAbingdon Square. And they\\u2019re all there, the rear-\\r\\r\\nGuard of the garrison of Fort New York:\\r\\r\\nThe skeleton defense of skinny girls\\r\\r\\nWho tap the typewriters of summertime;\\r\\r\\nThe pale male workers who know no time off\\r\\r\\nBecause too recently employed; the old\\r\\r\\nManhattan hands, in patched and gin-stained tweeds;\\r\\r\\nThe writers (Walker\\u2019s one), who see in their\\r\\r\\nCity as desert an oasis of\\r\\r\\nSilence and time to execute their plots\\r\\r\\nAgainst the state of things, but fall a prey\\r\\r\\nTo day succeeding day alone, and call\\r\\r\\nA party to restore themselves to all\\r\\r\\nThe inside jokes of winter, in whose caul\\r\\r\\nPeople click, kiss like billiard balls, and fall,\\r\\r\\nInsensible, into odd pockets. Dense\\r\\r\\nAs gander-feather winter snow, intense\\r\\r\\nAs inextinguishable summer sun\\r\\r\\nAt five o\\u2019clock (which it now is), the noise\\r\\r\\nOf Walker\\u2019s congeries of girls and boys\\r\\r\\nForegathered in their gabbling gratitude\\r\\r\\nStrikes down the stairwell from the altitude\\r\\r\\nOf his wide-open walk-up, beckoning\\r\\r\\nMe, solo, wife gone north, to sickening\\r\\r\\nTop-story heat and talk jackhammering\\r\\r\\nUpon the anvils of all ears. \\u201cChrist, Lou, you\\u2019re here,\\u201d\\r\\r\\nWhoops Walker, topping up a jelly jar\\r\\r\\n(\\u201cCrabapple,\\u201d says the label, still stuck on)\\r\\r\\nWith gin and tonic, a blue liquid smoke\\r\\r\\nThat seeks its level in my unexplored\\r\\r\\nInterior, and sends back a sonar ping\\r\\r\\nTo echo in my head. Two more blue gins.\\r\\r\\nThe sweat that mists my glasses interdicts\\r\\r\\nMy sizing up my interlocutor,\\r\\r\\nWho is, I think, the girl who lives next door,\\r\\r\\nA long-necked, fiddleheaded, celliform\\r\\r\\nGirl cellist propped on an improbably\\r\\r\\nSlim leg. Gin pings are now continuous.\\r\\r\\nThe room swings in its gimbals. In the bath\\r\\r\\nIs silence, blessed, relative, untorn\\r\\r\\nBy the cool drizzle of the bathtub tap,\\r\\r\\nA clear and present invitation. Like\\r\\r\\nA climber conquering K.28,\\r\\r\\nI clamber over the white porcelain\\r\\r\\nRock face, through whitish veils of rubberized\\r\\r\\nShower curtain, and at length, full-dressed, recline\\r\\r\\nIn the encaustic crater, where a fine\\r\\r\\nThread of cold water irrigates my feet,\\r\\r\\nTo sleep, perchance to dream of winter in\\r\\r\\nThe Village, fat with its full complement\\r\\r\\nOf refugees returned to their own turf\\u2014\\r\\r\\nUnspringy as it is\\u2014in a strong surf\\r\\r\\nOf retrogressing lemmings, faces fixed\\r\\r\\nOn the unlovely birthplace of their mixed\\r\\r\\nEmotions, marriages, media, and met-\\r\\r\\nAphors.

The Envoy to Constantinople was the seventh Earl of Elgin, who arranged for the Parthenon frieze to be conveyed to England in 1803.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nMay it please Lord Elgin, Earl of Kincardine,   \\r\\r\\nto consider the undersign’d, sole author   \\r\\r\\nand inventor of the Eidophusikon,\\r\\r\\nfor the position so lately rejected\\r\\r\\nby Mr. Turner. On giving the measure\\r\\r\\nof its Effects—calm & storm both, sunset\\r\\r\\nor moonlight, the accurate imitation\\r\\r\\nof Nature’s sounds: approaching thunder, the dash   \\r\\r\\nof waves on a pebbly beach, the distant gun—\\r\\r\\nmy Device was pronounc’d by no less a judge\\r\\r\\nthan Richard Wilson, R.A.—the same who cried out   \\r\\r\\nat the sight of Terni Cascade, “O well done,\\r\\r\\nwater, by God!”—was pronounc’d, I say, by him   \\r\\r\\n“highly successful in agitated seas,”   \\r\\r\\nby reason of the high finish carrying\\r\\r\\nseverally their satellites of color   \\r\\r\\ninto the very center of the Pictures.\\r\\r\\nAs it happens, your Lordship, I visited\\r\\r\\nthe same Joseph Turner known to your Lordship   \\r\\r\\n(I believe) only this week, and found a man   \\r\\r\\npacing to and fro before his pale muslin\\r\\r\\non which the sick and wan Sun, in all the doubt   \\r\\r\\nof darkness, was not allow’d to shed one ray,   \\r\\r\\nbut tears. Even as he work’d, pouring wet paint\\r\\r\\nonto paper till it was saturated,\\r\\r\\nthen tore, then scratch’d, then scrubb’d in a frenzy   \\r\\r\\nat the sheet, the Whole being chaos, until\\r\\r\\nas if by enchantment, the Scene appear’d then,   \\r\\r\\ngreat ships gone to pieces in order to fling   \\r\\r\\nmagical oranges on the waves—but I\\r\\r\\ndigress: even as he shew’d me two books fill’d   \\r\\r\\nwith studies from Nature, several tinted\\r\\r\\non the spot—which he found, he said, much the most\\r\\r\\nvaluable to him—this Turner discuss’d\\r\\r\\nthe present urgency of your Lordship’s need   \\r\\r\\nfor an artist who might draw Antiquities,\\r\\r\\nwith suitable finish, before Removal,\\r\\r\\nby your Lordship’s design, from Athens. He said   \\r\\r\\nhe could not, himself, endure the Ideal,\\r\\r\\nbut enjoy’d and look’d for only litter—why   \\r\\r\\neven his richest vegetation is confus’d,\\r\\r\\nhe delights in shingle, debris and mere heaps\\r\\r\\nof fallen stone. Upon communicating\\r\\r\\nthe intelligence that your Lordship’s stipend   \\r\\r\\nmust include assistance to Lady Elgin\\r\\r\\nin decorating fire-screens and the like,\\r\\r\\nthe man turn’d back in some heat to his labor   \\r\\r\\nupon what I took to be that mysterious\\r\\r\\nforest below London Bridge, where great ships ride,   \\r\\r\\nsails filling or falling, disorder’d too   \\r\\r\\nby the stress of anchorage, all beautiful\\r\\r\\nthough wild beneath the Daemonic pressure   \\r\\r\\nof his inquiry (with so much of the trowel,   \\r\\r\\nsurely a touch more finishing might be borne!).\\r\\r\\nEnough of Turner, I have not to speak here\\r\\r\\nof him, though what I saw was but the scribbling \\r\\r\\nof Painting, surely.
